# 20-mod-PhotoPortfolio Notes
## Getting Started
* To start a react project. Type the following in the CL: npx create-react-app <name of project>

## webpack: 
Bundles up and runs a development server that restarts when files are changed.

## App.js
* The file is the center of the application. Think of App.js as the root component, or the wrapper component that houses all of the other components. To effect any change on the application, we need to either modify this file or add components inside it.
* In app.js you will see a function that returns HTML / JSX

## Things to include on every page
* Import React in every component file. import React from 'react';
* You can also import any images or CSS you want to use at the top.
